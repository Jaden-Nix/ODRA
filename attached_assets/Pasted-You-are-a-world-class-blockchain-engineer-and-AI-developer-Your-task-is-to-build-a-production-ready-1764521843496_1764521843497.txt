You are a world-class blockchain engineer and AI developer. Your task is to build a production-ready ODRA-EVM Universal Contract Engine for Casper Testnet that fully integrates AI features without any mocked behavior. All contracts, AI logic, and demos must execute live on Casper Testnet.

Deliverables must include all code (Rust, TypeScript/Node.js, Solidity), deployment instructions, test scripts, dashboards, and live demo flows suitable for hackathon submission. The final product must also include AI-powered developer assistance and liquid staking advisory features.

1. Core Goals
	1.	Compile Solidity smart contracts → Casper-compatible Wasm
	2.	Deploy live to Casper Testnet via ODRA framework
	3.	Allow cross-chain interaction: Casper Testnet → EVM Testnet
	4.	Provide AI assistant for:
	•	Contract security and optimization suggestions
	•	Auto-translation of Solidity patterns → Casper storage & events
	5.	Provide AI yield advisor for LST contracts (cCSPR):
	•	Recommend staking strategy based on on-chain data
	•	Compute projected yield in real-time
	6.	Provide a CLI/SDK for developers: deploy contracts, call functions, query AI suggestions
	7.	Include live dashboards showing balances, staking, cross-chain status, and AI recommendations

2. Technical Specifications
	•	Input: Solidity source code or bytecode
	•	Output: Wasm contract ready for Casper Testnet
	•	Framework: Odra (Casper smart contract framework)
	•	Programming Languages: Rust for Wasm wrapper, TypeScript/Node.js for CLI/SDK, Python/JS for AI module
	•	Features:
	•	Full contract translation & compilation
	•	AI-powered code review, suggestions, and best practices
	•	Automatic event mapping (Solidity → Casper)
	•	Cross-chain messaging & token wrapping
	•	AI-powered staking advice dashboard
	•	Gas abstraction and user-friendly CLI

⸻

3. Architecture

AI must generate a full architecture diagram:
	•	Solidity contract → ODRA-EVM compiler → Casper Wasm
	•	AI Assistant module integrated into CLI
	•	Live staking dashboard & AI advisory engine
	•	Cross-chain wrapper for Testnet EVM chain
	•	Deployment & test flow for live contracts

⸻

4. Step-by-Step Live Build
	1.	Parse Solidity source code
	2.	Compile bytecode → intermediate representation
	3.	Map storage slots & events to Casper dictionaries
	4.	Wrap functions as Wasm entrypoints
	5.	Deploy live ERC-20 / ERC-721 contracts on Casper Testnet
	6.	Integrate AI assistant:
	•	On deploy or call, provide security, optimization, and Casper integration suggestions
	7.	Integrate AI staking advisor for cCSPR:
	•	Pull real staking stats from Testnet
	•	Suggest optimal staking split/strategy
	8.	Deploy a cross-chain wrapper on EVM Testnet (Sepolia)
	9.	Demonstrate live staking → receive cCSPR → wrap to w-cCSPR → show balances update
	10.	Generate live test scripts that call functions, track events, and validate AI recommendations

5. CLI / SDK Requirements
	•	odra-evm deploy <contract.sol> → compiles Solidity → Wasm → deploys to Casper Testnet
	•	odra-evm call <function> → executes function, shows AI suggestions
	•	odra-evm stake <amount> → stakes Testnet CSPR → returns live cCSPR balance + AI staking advice
	•	odra-evm cross-chain <amount> → wraps cCSPR → transfers to EVM Testnet, shows balances live

⸻

6. AI Modules
	•	AI Developer Assistant:
	•	Suggests optimizations, security checks, Casper-specific best practices
	•	Generates real-time tips for deployed contracts
	•	AI Yield Advisor:
	•	Pulls live staking data from Casper Testnet
	•	Predicts projected yield, suggests optimal staking allocation
	•	AI Cross-Chain Helper:
	•	Monitors real-time bridging events, estimates fees, detects failed transactions

⸻

7. Demo Script (Hackathon Ready)
	1.	Deploy ERC-20 contract via ODRA-EVM CLI on Casper Testnet
	2.	Show AI assistant suggestions during deployment
	3.	Stake Testnet CSPR → mint cCSPR → show AI yield recommendation
	4.	Wrap cCSPR → transfer → EVM Testnet → show live balance
	5.	Execute transfer() on ERC-20 contract → show live token balances update
	6.	Highlight AI suggestions and advisory panel on dashboard

⸻

8. Testing & Validation
	•	Unit tests and integration tests for all functions
	•	Validate cross-chain messages
	•	Validate staking yield calculations
	•	Validate AI suggestions accuracy against live testnet results

⸻

9. Deliverables
	•	Rust contracts (Wasm wrapper)
	•	TypeScript / Node.js CLI & SDK
	•	Solidity example contracts (ERC-20, ERC-721, Liquid Staking LST)
	•	AI modules for developer assistance & staking advisory
	•	Live test scripts & dashboard
	•	Architecture diagrams
	•	README.md and hackathon-ready instructions
	•	Video/demo flow for judges

⸻

10. Constraints
	•	Everything must execute live on Casper Testnet
	•	AI must not mock behavior; all outputs and suggestions reflect live data
	•	All contracts must follow security best practices
	•	CLI must be one-command deployment ready
